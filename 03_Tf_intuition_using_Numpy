#COFFEE ROASTING 
"""
In this lab, we will build a small neural network using Numpy. 
We will use the example of 'Coffee Roasting' which takes two input features temperature and duration to make the coffee. 
We will get output whether the coffee roast is good or bad. 
The neural network contains an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer.
