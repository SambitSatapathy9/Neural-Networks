CLASSIFICATION (Neural Networks)
Continuing our discussion from our previous lab, we will extend our idea to Classification (Neural Networks).
The same model selection process can also be used when choosing between different neural network architectures. 
In this section, we will create the models shown below and apply it to the same regression task above.

### 2.1 Split the dataset into training, cross-validation and test sets.

Scikit-learn provides the `train_test_split` function to split the data into the parts mentioned above. 
Here, the entire dataset is divided into 60% training, 20% cross-validation and 20% test sets.

"""
##Prepare the data 
We will use the same training, cross validation and the test sets we generated in the previous lab.
- We know that neural networks can learn non-linear relationships so you can opt to skip adding polynomial features. 
- The default `degree` is set to `1` to indicate that it will just use `x_train`, `x_cv`, and `x_test` as is (i.e. without any additional polynomial features).
